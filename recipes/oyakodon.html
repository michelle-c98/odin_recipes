        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            An epitome of Japanese soul food, oyakodon (親子丼) literally translates to parent-and-child (oya-ko) rice bowl (don) as the dish is composed of chicken and egg.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bite-size chicken, tender onion, and softly cooked egg are layered and simmered together in a sweet-salty sauce made with dashi, soy sauce, and mirin and served on a bed of steamed rice. The contrast of textures and flavors makes you craving for more bites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Gyudon and Katsudon, oyakodon is not only a long-time restaurant favorite but also a staple dish of Japanese households. Just as the name implies, everything about the rice bowl brings comfort and warmth.
